<!-- 
I'm Samarpan Basu from Naihati, a dedicated 3rd year computer science engineering student with an unwavering passion for web development. Through my academic journey, I've honed my skills in programming languages, front-end design, and back-end functionality. My enthusiasm for crafting seamless digital experiences drives me to continuously explore the ever-evolving world of technology.

Beyond coding, I find solace in the rhythm of music and the knowledge tucked within articles. These hobbies provide a refreshing escape during my free time. Whether it's delving into the latest tech trends or immersing myself in the melodic universe of music, these activities enrich my perspective and fuel my creativity. I also believe that these pursuits teach me about harmony, both in code and in life. With a curious mindset and a commitment to excellence, I'm excited to contribute my creativity and technical prowess to shaping the future of the digital landscape. -->
